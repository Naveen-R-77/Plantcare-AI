# Plant Disease Detection App - Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Required: Gemini AI API Key for plant disease detection
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Required: MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/plant-disease-app

# Required: JWT secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# Optional: Weather API key for enhanced predictions
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
```

### 3. Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key and paste it in your `.env.local` file

### 4. Start the Development Server

## üîß Troubleshooting Camera Issues

### Camera Not Working?
The app includes comprehensive camera debugging. If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Browser Permissions**: Ensure camera access is allowed
2. **Try Different Browsers**: Chrome and Edge work best
3. **Check Console Logs**: Open Developer Tools to see detailed error messages
4. **Use the Test Button**: Click "üß™ Test Camera Access" to diagnose issues

### Common Camera Errors:
- **NotAllowedError**: Camera permission denied - allow camera access
- **NotFoundError**: No camera detected - connect a camera device
- **NotReadableError**: Camera in use by another app - close other apps

## ü§ñ AI Analysis Features

### Gemini AI Integration
- **Primary Method**: Uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash for accurate plant disease detection
- **Fallback System**: Automatically falls back to demo analysis if API fails
- **Detailed Logging**: Check browser console for detailed API interaction logs

### What the AI Analyzes:
1. **Plant Type Identification**
2. **Disease Detection** (fungal, bacterial, viral)
3. **Severity Assessment** (Low/Medium/High)
4. **Treatment Recommendations**
5. **Prevention Strategies**
6. **Affected Plant Parts**

## üì± Camera Features

### Enhanced Camera Support:
- **Progressive Constraints**: Tries multiple camera configurations for compatibility
- **Environment Camera**: Prefers back camera for better plant photos
- **Quality Control**: Captures high-quality JPEG images
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows camera status and loading states

### Camera Workflow:
1. Click "Open Camera" ‚Üí Camera initializes with loading indicator
2. Wait for "Take Photo" button to become green
3. Capture photo ‚Üí Image automatically processed
4. Analyze with AI ‚Üí Get detailed disease analysis

## üåæ Location-Based Features

### Crop Advisory System:
- Enter your location to get region-specific farming advice
- AI analyzes local climate, soil conditions, and growing seasons
- Provides comprehensive recommendations for:
  - Suitable crops for your area
  - Soil management tips
  - Water management strategies
  - Pest and disease prevention
  - Market intelligence
  - Government schemes and subsidies

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Enable Detailed Logging:
The app includes extensive console logging. Open Developer Tools (F12) to see:
- Camera initialization steps
- Image capture details
- API request/response data
- Error messages with solutions

### Common Issues:
1. **"Gemini API not configured"**: Add your API key to `.env.local`
2. **"Camera not available"**: Check permissions and device connections
3. **"Analysis failed"**: Check internet connection and API key validity
4. **"Demo analysis shown"**: Normal fallback when API is unavailable

## üìä Performance Tips

### For Best Results:
- **Good Lighting**: Take photos in well-lit conditions
- **Clear Images**: Ensure plant leaves are clearly visible
- **Stable Connection**: Ensure good internet for AI analysis
- **Updated Browser**: Use latest Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

### Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Size**: Automatically optimized
- **Quality**: Higher quality = better AI analysis
- **Focus**: Clear focus on affected plant parts

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Architecture:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing analysis results
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user system
- **Camera**: WebRTC with progressive fallbacks

### Key Files:
- `components/disease-detection.tsx`: Main camera and analysis UI
- `lib/ai-services.ts`: Gemini AI integration and fallbacks
- `app/api/ai-detection/route.ts`: API endpoint for analysis
- `app/api/soil-analysis/route.ts`: Location-based crop advisory

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your `.env.local` configuration
3. Test camera access with the built-in test button
4. Ensure your Gemini API key has sufficient quota

The app is designed to work even without API keys by providing demo analysis results for testing purposes.
